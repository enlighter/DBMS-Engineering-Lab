first test env: http://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-4.html, http://www.cloudera.com/get-started/cloudera-live.html

can't signup with a credit card to aws, so cannot get to cloudera live...
Going to setup a cloudera CDH using the auto mode through cloudera manager.
Follow this guide and also follow additional guide page for single-node mode:
http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_ig_install_path_a.html#cmig_topic_5_5_unique_2
We'll need an ubuntu 14.04 actual installation for this
Keep following the installation process, 
At "Specify hosts for your CDH cluster installation." step in cloudera manager installation wizard, only use localhost
as that is where i am doing everything, but you will need to follow the ssh setup part of 
the README.md in the learning_process/hadoop-single-node-ubuntu-14.04/ folder
