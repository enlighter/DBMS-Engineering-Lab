cloudera is the one-stop shop for hadoop, and is run by people including the founder of hadoop.
Hadoop environment system (CDH) is a comprehensive solution to manage hadoop installation.
tutorial : http://www.cloudera.com/developers/get-started-with-hadoop-tutorial/setup.html
first test env: http://www.cloudera.com/downloads/quickstart_vms/5-4.html, http://www.cloudera.com/get-started/cloudera-live.html

can't signup with a credit card to aws, so cannot get to cloudera live...
Going to setup a cloudera CDH using the auto mode through cloudera manager.
Follow this guide and also follow additional guide page for single-node mode:
http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/enterprise/latest/topics/cm_ig_install_path_a.html#cmig_topic_5_5_unique_2
We'll need an ubuntu 14.04 actual installation for this
Keep following the installation process, 
At "Specify hosts for your CDH cluster installation." step in cloudera manager installation wizard, only use localhost
as that is where i am doing everything, but you will need to follow the ssh setup part of 
the README.md in the learning_process/hadoop-single-node-ubuntu-14.04/ folder

Ran into problems with the cluster instatllation step -> not getting heartbeat for the started agent (port 7182)
Here's how I solved it:
Edit the /etc/hostname file with the following:
###Within-the-hashes-is-the-entire-contents-of-my-/etc/hostname-file###
localhost



#######################################################################

Update the /etc/hosts to look like this:
(it should be of the format : <IP address> <FQDN> <shortname>)
#######################################################################
127.0.0.1       localhost       lch
127.0.1.1       enlighter       enlighter

*// Keep the rest as it is //*
#######################################################################

Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file to disable IPv6.  Add the following at the end of the file:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
vm.swappiness = 10


Then restart the cloudera-scm-agent :
sudo service cloudera-scm-agent restart

After succesful restart of the agent, go to the installion browser screen and click retry button to retry the installation.
